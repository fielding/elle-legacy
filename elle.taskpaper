* Organize Files/Folders to reflect the XCode project hierarchy
* Implement EntityManager ( as much as I dislike the word manager)
* Figure out a way to allow games to extend the “CoreSystems”
* Implement unique configuration for each game via configuration file
* “EntityFactory” or some way to load entities from a file (data driven)
* Evaluate pointer usage; switch to shared or unique ptrs where possible
